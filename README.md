# React and Express Project: The Cornetto Trilogy Fan Page with Authentication

## Description

This project is a full-stack web application celebrating "The Cornetto Trilogy." It features a frontend built with React, offering an interactive user experience, and a backend developed using Express.js, which manages user authentication. This setup allows fans to explore and engage with content related to the famous film series.

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

Before beginning the installation process, ensure you have Node.js, npm (Node Package Manager), Git, and a suitable text editor or IDE installed on your system. These tools are essential for setting up both the React frontend and the Express.js backend.

### Setting Up the Frontend (React)

1. **Clone the Frontend Repository**: 
   - First, you will need to clone the frontend repository from its source on the web to your local machine. This step involves using Git to pull the entire React codebase to your computer.

2. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**: 
   - After cloning, change your working directory to the newly created frontend directory. This step is crucial for running the subsequent installation commands in the correct folder.

3. **Install Dependencies**: 
   - In the frontend directory, install all the necessary packages that the React application requires. This is done using npm, which reads the `package.json` file and downloads all the listed dependencies.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`
Certainly! I'll revise the README file to exclude specific bash command examples and focus more on the content and explanation of the installation process.

### Setting Up the Backend (Express.js)

1. **Clone the Backend Repository**: 
   - Similar to the frontend, clone the backend repository which contains the Express.js application. This step will set up the backend portion of your project on your machine.

2. **Navigate to the Backend Directory**: 
   - Switch to the directory where the backend code is stored. This ensures that all backend setup commands are executed in the correct context.

3. **Install Backend Dependencies**: 
   - Inside the backend directory, use npm to install the necessary dependencies for the Express.js server. This step is crucial for the proper functioning of the backend.

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Backend Server**: 
   - In the backend directory, initiate the Express.js server. This server is responsible for handling API requests, including user authentication.

2. **Start the React Frontend**: 
   - In a separate terminal or command line interface, navigate to the frontend directory and start the React development server. This action will launch the frontend part of your application.

## Using the Application

With both the frontend and backend running, you can navigate through the application, experiencing the dynamic content related to "The Cornetto Trilogy." The application allows for user interaction and provides information across various pages, all connected through React Router.

## Technologies Used

The project leverages several technologies, including:
- React.js for the frontend
- Bootstrap for React for styling
- React Router for navigation
- Node.js and Express.js for the backend server
- MongoDB (assumed) for data storage
- Axios for making HTTP requests
- CORS for cross-origin resource sharing
